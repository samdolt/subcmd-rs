Cargo style subcommand

This library help to build an app that use a similar command line interface
as Cargo or Git:

```bash
$ myproject build --with --some --option
$ myproject clean
$ myproject --help
```

i.e. Automaticaly pass argv to a corresponding subcommand (here build or clean).

## Feature

- Subcommand parser and runner
- Autogenerated help for `myproject --help` and `myproject -h`

## Futur plans

- [ ] Subcommand help with `myproject help subcommand`
- [ ] Search for `myproject-cmd-subcommand` in the $PATH if there is no built-in subcommand.
- [ ] Allow project wide option like `myproject --verbose clean` instead of `myproject clean --verbose`
